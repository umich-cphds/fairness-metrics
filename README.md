# Reporting of Fairness Metrics in Clinical Risk Prediction Models: A Call for Change

This repository includes tables and figures from the body of the corresponding article and documents from its appendix.

**Abstract**: Fairness metrics are important tools for evaluating potential disparities across sensitive features in the field of prediction modeling. In this paper, we seek to assess the uptake of fairness metrics in clinical risk prediction modeling by conducting a literature review of recent high impact publications in the areas of cardiovascular disease and COVID-19. Our review shows that fairness metrics are rarely used in clinical risk prediction modeling despite their ability to identify bias and flag potential discrimination. We also find that the data used in clinical riskprediction modelsremain largely demographically homogeneous, demonstrating an urgent need for collecting and using datafrom diverse populations. To address these issues, we suggest specific strategies for increasing the use of fairnessmetrics while developing clinical risk prediction models.
